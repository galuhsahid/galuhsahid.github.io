   <p>I was the Person in Charge of Visual Design for CompFest7. Aside of leading a team of visual designers &amp; directing the branding of CompFest7, I also designed <a href="http://compfest.web.id/7/">the website for CompFest7</a>. In 2015, the website was one of only three websites <a href="https://twitter.com/IDBYTE/status/649945213482352640">nominated in BUBU Awards in Web - Non-profit/Awareness category</a>.</p>
