   <p>Aside of being the Creative and Documentation Staff, I was also involved in volunteering, such as teaching English to the less unfortunate kids and organizing public discussions of various issues which included AIDS, cancer awareness, volunteerism, and many more.</p>

   <p>I designed &amp; developed the website; the website was custom designed and powered by <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I also made some promotional materials, from branding posters until event flyers.<br /></p>
