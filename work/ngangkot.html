   <h2>Chapter I: Background</h2>
   <a name="problem"></a>
   <h5>A Part of the Problem, A Part of the Solution</h5>

   <p>It is no secret that Jakarta's traffic jams are the worst. On the other hand, we actually have a wide array of public transportation at our disposal ready to be used such as CommuterLine, Kopaja, Metromini, and angkot. The irony is that for some reason <strong>people aren't using public transportation</strong>, although it is significantly cheaper and most of all, it has a huge potential to solve the problem that has plagued Jakarta for a long time that is the traffic.</p>

   <p>There is no straightforward way to solve Jakarta's traffic jam. If such solution existed, we would have been freed of it since a long time ago. However, of course we can always try to solve a part of the problem and make it as a part of the solution. A part of that problem is public transportation.</p>

   <p><em>But if people aren't even using public transportation, then how could we turn it into a part of the solution?</em></p>

   <a name="use"></a>
   <h5>Getting People to Use Public Transportation</h5>

  <p>To get to the root of the problem, we began our journey by interviewing people. We didn't go straight to the story that we were making an application&ndash;there was still a possibility that the answer wasn't exactly a mobile app, anyway. We tried to find out what is it that makes people reluctant to use public transportation in Jakarta.</p>

  <p>Through our interviews, we figured out that when using public transportation, people consider three main things: <strong>cleanliness</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, and <strong>ease</strong>. These three factors played a huge role in a person's decision-making process when considering public transportation, be it as a day-to-day decision (such as "I'm going to go to the mall today using TransJakarta because there happens to be a bus stop nearby") or a long term decision (such as "Jakarta's public transportation is too dangerous, especially at night&ndash;I'd rather commute to work with my car").</p>

  <p>Realistically speaking, it is difficult to deal with the first two factors. Those are the two areas that heavily depend on the government. However, we can still manage to tackle the third factor: <strong>ease</strong>.</p>

  <p>There are a lot of ways that might affect a person's ease in a journey using public transportation. Troubles finding out information about which route or which kind of public transportation to use is one of them; it can even affect one's ease in using public transportation <em>even</em> before the journey even starts. And it has happened a lot of times, considering how complex (and most of the time, haphazhard) Jakarta's public transportation can get.</p>

  <p>That's how we came up with <strong>Ngangkot!</strong>. We aimed to solve this particular pain point by giving Jakartans a step-by-step guide to using public transportation. Finding information is now no longer a hassle. When deciding to use public transportation, they no longer need to take some time to piece all the information together. It's just one search away, and you're good to go.</p>

  <a name="chapter2"></a>
  <h2>Chapter II: What the Users Want &amp; Need</h2>

  <a name="purpose"></a>
  <h5>User Analysis: Purpose for the Users</h5>
  <p>We are well aware that there are existing applications with a similar aim already. However, being a Jakartan who depends on public transportation almost all the time, I can vouch that there is still a gap between the existing applications &amp; what we, as the users, need. This too is shown by the result of our interviews: despite the existing applications, rarely anyone depends on these mobile applications to navigate their way in Jakarta using public transportation. People still ask their friends, family, or Google. After all that hassle, they probably still have to piece all of the information together, which is far from convenient.</p>

  <p>This serves as our main motivation to <strong>put the users first</strong>. It means that whatever features we decide to have by the end aren't there just for the sake of existing; they're there because they serve as a purpose for our users.</p>

  <p>Scraping our assumptions from day one by jumping into (and spending more time) interviews did prove to be useful. It became more obvious to us: which features would merely serve as eye-candies, and which features are the ones that users will really need and use? We didn't go straight from interviews to building features right away, but the interviews did serve as our framework throughout the journey.</p>

  <p>We began by getting in depth with our users. From our interviews, we managed to obtain information such as each perosn's charateristics, motivation, and purpose when using public transportation. Going further, we also synthesized other facts into our persona design, such as interviewees' knowledge in using public transportation and even their daily activities, since commuting is tightly tied into a person's activities throughout the day. This resulted in three personas, which would guide every of our design decision later.</p>

  <a name="scenario"></a>
  <h5>Workflow Analysis: Putting Users into Context</h5>
  <p>Personas give us an overview of our users: who they are, what their pain points are, and what they're seeking to achieve from using public transportation. The next thing we do is putting our personas into context in order to figure out how exactly our application can help them achieve their goals and solve their problems. The personas that we created earlier really aided us in emphatizing with our users, which is important when we're building something that people want &amp; need.</p>

  <p>We developed scenarios for each persona; this helped us to know what they're think and what they're going through &ndash; be it habits, tasks, or even obstacles.</p>

  <a name="mental-model"></a>
  <h5>Piecing It All Together with Mental Model</h5>
  <p>With the results obtained from both our user and workflow analysis, we determined which features should exist in the application. We use mental model diagram to help translate the results of our analysis into requirements. We divided the diagram into tasks with different behaviors. Mental model diagram will serve as our visualization that can help us determine which features will be useful, which innovations we should pursue, and which features that aren't necessary.</p>

  <img src="../../assets/images/ngangkot/mentalmodel.jpg" />

  <p>From the mental model, we came up with the basic underlying principles for Ngangkot!:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: The goal of Ngangkot! is to give users a step-by-step guide and information on how to use public transportation to reach their destination. All features, therefore, should aim to achieve that.</li>
    <li><strong>Usability</strong>: Focusing on functionality doesn't mean that we're ignoring usability. Ngangkot! should be easy to use for anyone. Necessary information should be ready at users' disposal, presented in a clear &amp; concise manner.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>... and extracted the following features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Navigation</strong>: The goal of Ngangkot! is to give users a step-by-step guide and information on how to use public transportation to reach their destination. All features, therefore, should aim to achieve that.</li>
    <li><strong>Alert</strong>: Focusing on functionality doesn't mean that we're ignoring usability. Ngangkot! should be easy to use for anyone. Necessary information should be ready at users' disposal, presented in a clear &amp; concise manner.</li>
    <li><strong>Notification</strong>: Focusing on functionality doesn't mean that we're ignoring usability. Ngangkot! should be easy to use for anyone. Necessary information should be ready at users' disposal, presented in a clear &amp; concise manner.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Chapter III: Design Matters</h2>
  <a name="wireframe"></a>
  <h5>Wireframe</h5>
  <p>Now that we have a handful of features we're confident to continue with, we began the process of wireframing. At this stage, we're focusing on getting the right workflow between each screen.</p>

  <p><strong>Homepage.</strong> <em>You only need to type your destination &amp; the application will do the rest. It is important to keep simplicity in mind, since when people are using public transportation, it is most likely that they're in a hurry or don't have much time to navigate a more complex interface.</em></p>

  <p>The application itself is still a concept; there's not much going on with the development yet. If you'd like to find out more about this project, its other features or anything really please <a href="http://x.galuhsahid.com/about/#contact">let me know</a>.</p>
