## The Background
I treat my Twitter likes like bookmarks of links I want to read later. One day I wanted to read this paper write-up, only to find out that the tweet has been buried under a myriad of other tweets (cat fallling from its bed GIF, nyinyir tweets, & other tweets that actually matter) that I've liked. Ain't got time to scroll them all, right? 

... which is why I made [aime][http://github.com/galuhsahid/aime]--yeah, it's French for "like". I know, if there's one thing I'm worse at than cooking, it has to be picking out package names.

## Why Node.js
1. It's the first thing that I can imagine building it with
2. There are many cool libraries that can support you to build your own CLI tool

## Libraries
I used more libraries than these, but these are the ones I use for the CLI stuff:

- blessed
- blessed-contrib
- minimist
- chalk

Another library I used in the process but later abandoned is commander, which I'll talk about later!

Let's get to the how.
