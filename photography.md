<p class="f5 lh-copy measure">I used to take a lot of pictures during my travels&mdash;well, scratch that, I used to have my camera with me every single day. Nowadays, not so much. Sometimes I'm too lazy to bring my camera; other times, I want to sketch instead (it's hard to keep up doing both at the same time, trust me). In other cases, I just want to completely enjoy my surrounding without having to do both. Hence, most of these pictures are from a few years ago, around 2010 until 2014-ish.</p>

<p class="f5 lh-copy measure">If you're interested, the tools of the trade are Nikon D3000 or Leica. Post-processes are done in Adobe Photoshop.</p>
