At the first glance this is a guilty pleasure, but I guess I really enjoyed reading the book because I've heard similar tales--mostly my parents' friends or friends of friends who are real crazy rich Asians. Some characters are real over the top--we're talking *crazy, rich* people after all--but I like that there's always a balance between characters who are completely crazy and those that are... how can I put it, more normal? The plot itself is really light, there isn't much going on except *a lot* of gossiping and feasts. What's amusing I think are the conversations and banters. There are tons of cultural references too which can be fun (and do tell a lot about a culture) to learn about. A nice read if you're looking for a different kind of light read.
