I delved into this book with a fear that I might not be able to relate to it as much as I'd love to. I was worried I haven't had enough experiences to be able to get something meaningful out of this (by meaningful, I'm talking about something that I'm able to thoroughly process, not just to *know*). 

I'm so glad that I was wrong.

There are a lot of great takeaways, but my favorite is a two-page (sub?)chapter titled **P.S.: Serendipity is Not Luck**. The first paragraph talks about how, ever since Joi Ito was a little boy, everyone kept saying "focus focus focus". Then he went on saying that he was never one to focus; everything excites him. I know this feeling too well, and over the years I've been pondering whether it is something that I should change or stick to. 

He states that serendipity is a combination of the following things:
- creating a network and an environment rich with weak ties,
- a peripheral vision that is "switched on",
- and an enthusiasm for engagement that attracts and encourages interaction.

The term "weak ties" refers to Mark Granovetter's theory, ["The Strength of Weak Ties"](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf). I haven't read the entire paper, but I looked it up to gain some more context and it made sense: according to Granovetter, "emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups". Joi Ito puts it this way: "connections outside of your normal circle often provide the most value". 

Another way to think about it that makes sense to me the most is that people with strong ties most likely have access to the same knowledge, while people with weak ties have access to different knowledges, which gives more room for innovation and new ideas. If we were to apply this on a personal level, I guess this is the same thing as familiarizing yourself with multiple disciplines.

It may seem a little bit far-fetched, but I think the following points do echo the same sentiment:
- I really don't remember where I read this, but I read somewhere something along the line that the next breakthrough of AI won't come from computer science. I'll update this once I remember, but I do agree that the statement is very plausible.
- [The surprising thing Google learned about its employees â€” and what it means for today's students](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students/?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.d4e5af821b5b&__twitter_impression=true): the most important qualities of Google's top employees aren't STEM expertise, but soft skills, which according to the article "sound more like what one gains as an English or theater major than as a programmer."
