I grew up (by *grew up* I mean getting through my teenage years) with all of John Green's books, so despite no longer being the target market for young adult books, I know I have to read this anyway.

Upon learning that the title of the book is "Turtles All the Way Down", I smiled. I first read the story about "it's turtles all the way down!" when reading A Brief History of Time (it's literally in the first page!). So I thought, hey, this book is gonna have some cosmology flavor in it! Finally! 
However, it turns out that it's not the main point of the book, so moving on...

If you've read John Green you probably know the regular complaints. One of them is "characters that do not talk their age", in which, yes, I can vouch for that because really, I could never speak like that even if I tried. There is also the "teenagers who are philosophers" problem, but I don't think this is valid because no matter how cheeseballz they may seem, teenagers are capable of generating ~deep thoughts. Anyway, by the time I'm reading this book, I've made peace with all these complaints. Sure, go have your teenage philosophers roaming around talking like they're 40 (spoiler: it's not really that bad here, trust me. I think he's got it toned down a little bit).

What I like:
- I don't have one myself, but it seems like there is an accurate portrayal of how OCD is like, at least coming from me as an outsider. Those who do have one might have a different idea, I don't know. But speaking from an outsider's perspective, what's written and told is believable.
- I somehow like that the main character's relationship with her best friend is not all smooth-sailing. 

What I don't like:
- I can't remember anything in particular now, will get back if I think of one...


### Highlighted

I actually got things highlighted but then I had to remove my book from my iBooks because somehow it just stopped working and thus, I lost all highlights.
