This reads like a great thriller novel--it's very well-paced with a masterfully written narrative that leaves the twists at the right place. I finished the last half in one sitting, no kidding.

What surprised me was although I've been following the Theranos news before the WSJ expos√© broke, I never really realized how extensive and elaborate the lies were until I read the book. I've read some stories in this book in the previous WSJ articles, but when you read all of them in a chronological order along with all the details never mentioned before, it gives a more damning effect. 

My favorite parts were Erika and Tyler. I found it admirable that despite their young age, they were willing to go great lengths to call out Theranos for what they're doing. I understand that this is a complex situation--not everyone has the privilege to risk their job, after all. But it's nice to see examples which remind you that whenever you can, please, please stand up for what's right.
