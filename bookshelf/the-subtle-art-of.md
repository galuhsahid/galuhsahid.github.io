I lost all of my notes for this book because I had to delete my book from iBooks... so, yeah. A quick "review": I like this book. To be honest, 2017 was such a reflexive year for me that I was so surprised to discover I could relate to most of the points and punch lines, but of course that does not diminish this book's values. In fact, it sort of... validates it? Like this is not total BS.

If you're not the usual self-help book kind of person but figure you can use a little slap in the face, go grab this book.
