*It's inching closer towards the end*.

For the past 1.5 years I've been exclusively working on [this][cf]. To say that I'm learning a lot is *still* an understatement--I could devote an entire paper on that. Or maybe an entire book. But some things must come to an end. In preparation for that, I've been thinking about what's going to be my next adventure in life; the goal that I want to pursue, at least for the next few months.

It's not surprising that I find myself wanting to do *a lot*. I want to continue writing that book! Learn more music pieces! Learn React! Catch up with the latest developments on cosmology even though it's not my major! Design &amp; craft pretty things! Paint! Travel! Build a web app! It's not once or twice that I end up doing too many things at once. There's just *so* much beauty in everything... too much, even.

Sometimes I wonder why I am the way I am, but I guess that's no use. There's beauty in everything &amp; I guess there's beauty in being *too* excited about the world. But I think it's a good idea to learn to **focus** and **prioritize**. The fact that we only have 24 hours a day is no joke.

So... I tried to prioritize and still ended up with way too many things on my list. Dead end.

Confused, I went to ask my mother; perhaps *she* was the reason I am the way I am, after all. It's in the genes. I gave her the list and she asked a simple question: "which one of these is the **hardest**?"

I pondered and came up with an answer.

*Of course*.

This is not the first time that I ended up choosing the hard way. In fact, after much thinking, I realize that I've *always* opted to have it the hard way. This time there's no reason why I shouldn't, because having it the hard way never disappoints me. It's by no means easy, but it's fun. It's exciting. There's beauty in everything, but I've always found much more beauty there.

Maybe one day, I'll get to the point where choosing the hard way has become a part of my comfort zone. There will probably be a day where I have to settle with something easier; something less challenging. But, well, this is a note to self: when I have no absolute reason *not* to choose the hard way, that's the way to go.
