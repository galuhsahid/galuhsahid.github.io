I've been relying on these two things to get myself through the days:
1. The prospect of learning something new
2. The opportunity to help people, regardless who they are--strangers, family, friends, etc.

I realize that one day I might wake up and find myself not having enough energy to go to work/school/run errands. Or I can wake up and discover that the people I care about no longer care/love me back. 

But over time I learned that I can never run out of things to learn and kindness to give every day, no matter how small, even when I'm at my worst. I can choose to grab my phone and decide to look up what's an iptable. Even though I don't read the whole thing, that still counts as something. When I'm at my worst and feel like the world is falling apart, *not* snapping up at people is kind enough. Not sure how you can quantize kindness, it's probably still a very tiny amount of kindness compared to, say, making people happy, but it's still something.
