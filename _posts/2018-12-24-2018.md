I was actually debating whether to write this or not, because 2018 has been difficult. The highs were high, but the lows were very low. It's a mixed bag & honestly I still don't know what to make of it, so I guess I'll just keep this short and sweet!

2018 started with my bachelor's thesis defense. The day before that I got called, for the first time ever, to my lecturer's office because according to him, "this (my final paper) is great but it's impossible that you wrote a paper this good", which was simultaneously the biggest insult and the greatest compliment I've ever received in my life. I graduated after 3.5 gruelling years because I couldn't stand another semester of final exams, & I 10/10 would not recommend because let me tell you: I can still feel how burned out I am today. 

Post-graduation I immediately started my first full-time job & I was awarded this year's MVP for the Data team which was still a shocker to this day because *wtfhowdidthathappen*. I gave my first international talk at [PyCon APAC](http://pycon.sg). I went on to speak at four more meetups and conferences ([CS UI Dev Meetup](https://www.facebook.com/groups/154570601553683/), [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com), [MozBelajar](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mozbelajar-rust-meetup-tickets-49522987589#), [PyCon ID](http://pycon.id)) with four different talks in three different programming languages & two human languages. I also moderated this year's PyCon ID---my first time moderating a conference. I also participated in [Increasing Rust's Reach](http://reach.rust-lang.org/) which had been a priceless help for me to get started with Rust & open source in general (this I 10/10 would recommend!).

I didn't travel much, but I spent a week with myself in Isle of Skye---a much needed break considering that I had dived into employment right after college. One of my happiest memories in 2018 was when I was sitting at the seaside of Portree, eating fish & chips, when it suddenly struck me that *"heck, I love being with myself"*. (Hint: that self-love didn't last long).

I bought tickets to four different concerts only to sell them last minute simply because I was too exhausted to go that I'd rather stay at home, but in the end I forced myself to go watch MLTR's concert so I could see *The Actor* being sung live.

Last year's highlight was meeting wonderful people. This year I met even more wonderful people--hard-working, smart, kind people I truly look up to. People who would go out of their way to help me. What would I do without all of you?

At the beginning of the year I decided to stop buying paperbacks. As much as I love flipping through physical papers, it's hard to argue against the practicality of e-books. It didn't take long until I got tired of reading through my tiny iPhone screen, so I bought myself a Kindle Paperwhite. [I read 37 books](https://www.notion.so/e8b2f3debbf24bfd8de9d6ad38e6b3fa?v=6c938344240a43559756d1c96e9f6379), 15 books short from my target of 52 (one book each week) but considering that last year I only read a measly 6 books, I'm totally happy with this. Here are my favorites:
- *Becoming* by Michelle Obama
- *Pachinko* by Min-Jin Lee
- *Stories of Your Life and Others* by Ted Chiang
- *I am Malala* by Malala Yousafzai
- *Born a Crime* by Trevor Noah
- *The Immortalists* by Chloe Benjamin
- *Exit West* by Mohsin Hamid
- *iWoz* by Steve Wozniak and Gina Smith

I also made more sketches than last year. I created 30-ish sketches for my friends' graduation gifts. I remember that some years ago I wrote a blog post on how I find gifts useless---note that I was not a big fan of human interactions & being social was something I had to *consciously* learn, so it's funny to see how my perspective has changed over time. In fact, I actually want to explore what other handmade gifts I can make & give to people in various occasions.

Lots of days were hard, & during these days music would sometimes be the only thing that actually light up my day. My favorite albums that were released this year are Villagers' *The Art of Pretending to Swim*, Aly & AJ's *Ten Years* (still don't get why this is not a hit), HONNE's *Love Me / Love Me Not*, & George Ezra's *Staying at Tamara's*. My favorite TV series that I discovered/were released this year are *The Good Place* & *Sharp Objects*. Also, *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch* was pretty cool.

This year I learned Rust, Vue, & Scala (which I get to use at work!). I created some side projects for funsies: [find-coordinate-points](https://github.com/galuhsahid/find-coordinate-points) which is a quick tool I made to help me at work, [maknyus-ipsum](https://github.com/galuhsahid/maknyus-ipsum) which is a lorem ipsum generator but with Indonesian food, [indonesian-word-embedding](https://github.com/galuhsahid/indonesian-word-embedding), & a Bash prompt editor that has been a WIP since March (I'm working on making it public). Three of them were made with Vue. I think the Vue + Flask combo would be my go-to stack for most (web app) side projects from now on. I contributed to some open source projects too, ranging from bug fix, adding new feature, to adding translation. At first I thought these didn't seem like much, but given that I worked on these side projects on top of my full-time job, I think I should give myself a pat in the back.

## Looking back
Last year I wrote these:
- Find the **balance between CS and non-CS things**: I read more books than 2017 and complete more sketches---I think I can say this is a success. I like to think of 2018 as the year where I reclaimed my old hobbies back. There were some I actively decided not to pursue anymore (e.g. graphic design), & there are some that I haven't had a chance to yet (e.g. writing. I signed up for NaNoWriMo but it didn't fall through. However now I have a book idea that I really want to start working on next year!)
- **A slower life**: Technically, yes, I did have a slower life. But honestly I'm just as exhausted.
- **Be nicer**: I tried!
- I wrote about some **initiatives** I care about, & how I wanted to work on those in 2018. I think I didn't do much about this in 2018---adjusting to life post-graduation was tough. Next year I'll be organizing PyLadies Indonesia & Global CFP Day Jakarta, so maybe 2019 would be the year. :-)

## Next year
What I want to learn next year:
- Generative art. My passion for art is inherited while my passion for computers comes out of *nowhere*. I've always thought of the two things as two diverging paths, so it'd be interesting to see how the two play out together (plus, generative art would make pretty cool gifts & bedroom decor).

As you may have noticed, I'm purposefully limiting the new things I want to learn next year because my head can only hold so much.

What I want to do more next year:
- More doodling. Doodling in sketches, in writings, in ideas. Not everything has to be perfect or 100% well-formatted. 
- Write. That. Book.
- Make running as a part of my routine.
- Since *being nice* is too broad of a resolution, here's for next year: maintain the relationships I already have (don't forget birthdays!) & make great new ones.

The most important thing, though, I hope I can be kinder to myself. This year I beat myself up for all the things I thought I wasn't doing well at (regardless of what people told me, even when they told me otherwise), all the things I didn't achieve, & all the smallest mistakes that seem inconsequential in hindsight. I realized this was becoming harmful when I started to question everyone who was nice to me & any kind of compliment & appreciation that I got because I felt like I didn't deserve it, it was a mistake, I'm a fraud, gosh the list goes on. Consequentially, this is one of the reasons why 2018 was difficult for me---I was fighting with the voice in my head for almost 24/7.

Whew, I didn't mean to end this post in a sad note. Luckily though, writing this kind of post helps me remember all the good things that happened in 2018. I hope your 2018 went well, & let's cheers for a better 2019.
