<p class="f5 lh-copy measure">I love making <s>sloppy</s> sketches. I found it relaxing, &amp; it sort of forces me to notice the details I otherwise wouldn't have noticed. Sometimes I paint too, but oftentimes laziness sets in. Sketching is simpler, &amp; is good enough for me most of the time.</p>

<p class="f5 lh-copy measure">Tools of the trade are Sakura Micron pens&mdash;I swear by them. Watercolor is Winsor &amp; Newton, papers are usually Canson but I usually am not too picky except when painting.</p>
