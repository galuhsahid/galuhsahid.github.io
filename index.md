<h1>Hi, I'm Galuh.</h1>

<p class="f5 lh-copy measure">I'm an undergraduate computer science student at Universitas Indonesia. I'm currently working as a data scientist intern in a fintech company, turning big data into usable data products where users can get various valuable insights from.

<p class="f5 lh-copy measure">In the past, I have worked as a freelance full-stack web developer &amp; graphic designer. I was also involved in <a href="http://compfest.web.id">CompFest</a>&mdash;the biggest IT event in Indonesia created by students of Universitas Indonesia. You should check it out if you haven't!</p>

<p class="f5 lh-copy measure">From time to time, I also enjoy coding stuff for fun, <a href="/sketches">sketching buildings and statues I've been to/seen</a>, traveling <a href="/photography">(&amp; taking photographs whilst)</a>, writing fiction, &amp; reading&mdash;currently, I'm reading Taiye Selasi's <em>Ghana Must Go</em>.</p>
