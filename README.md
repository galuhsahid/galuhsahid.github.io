=============================

... is my little home on the World Wide Web. 😁

Here I put my writings, projects, pictures I took on my travels, as well as my sketches. It's a little bit of everything.

To make the website happen, I utilized the following tools:

- [**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.org), a static site generator.
- [**jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync**](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync), which already setups Jekyll, GulpJS, SASS, AutoPrefixer &amp; BrowserSync for you. Makes life easier, trust me. 👌
- [**SASS**](http://sass-lang.com)
- [**sass-boilerplate**](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate)
- [**kramdown**](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html)
- [**MathJax**](www.mathjax.org/), to display fancy Math equations.
