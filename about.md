Hi, I'm Galuh. This is my blog &amp; portfolio. Here I write about my exploration on data, development, & everything else that tickles my fancy. My blog is mainly for learning purposes&ndash;I learn better when I write down the things I'm learning, hence the existence of this blog.

<h2>Me</h2>
I'm a computer science student in Universitas Indonesia. My interests also include product development, product design, and learning languages (currently <s>struggling with</s> learning French).

When not dabbling in all those, I spend my time reading, writing <s>purple proses</s> stories, taking pictures of strangers I meet on my travels &amp; sketching places. Yes, I probably do too many things. No, you're not the first person to say that. Yes, sometimes I get confused too.
