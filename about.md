<h1>About</h1>

Hello! I'm Galuh. This is my blog &amp; portfolio. Here I write about my exploration on data, development, &amp; everything else that tickles my fancy. My blog is mainly for learning purposes&ndash;I learn better when I write down the things I'm learning.

<h2>Me</h2>
I'm a computer science student in Universitas Indonesia. I'm currently working as a data science intern at a fintech company, building various data products that turn big data into useful (and oftentimes, fascinating) insights.

In the past, I have dabbled in graphic design, web design, UX, and web development.

When not dabbling in all those, I spend my time reading, writing fiction, learning French, taking pictures of the places I go to &amp; strangers I meet on my travels &amp; sketching places. Yes, I probably do too many things. No, you're not the first person to say that. Yes, sometimes I get confused too.
