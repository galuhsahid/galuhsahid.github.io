description: Hi, I'm Galuh. This is my blog & portfolio.

Here I write about my exploration on data, development, & everything else that tickles my fancy. My blog is mainly for learning purposesâ€“I learn better when I write down the things Iâ€™m learning, hence the existence of this blog.

### Me
I'm a computer science student at Universitas Indonesia. Right now, I am:

- Working as a data scientist intern in a fintech company, turning big data into usable data products where users can get various valuable insights from. 
- Trying to survive my 4th year of college. ðŸ˜£

In the past, I have:

- Worked as a freelance full-stack web developer--from web design, UX, frontend, to backend. If it sounds exhausting to you, it was... which is why I don't do it much anymore (hint: maybe try not to do all at the same time and you will be fine!).
- Worked as a freelance graphic designer. Fun times! Even though I don't do it much anymore, bad typography still hurts every fiber of my being. 
- Involved in the biggest IT event in Indonesia with hundreds of other cool people and startups. Go check it out, because if you don't, you're missing out on a lot. :)

Things I do from time to time:

- Build small tools as side projects to make my life (and hopefully other people's lives) a tad bit easier.
- Read books. 
- Travel.
- Sketch places, especially of buildings and statues.
- Photographs said places and strangers I meet on the street.
- Play my favorite TV series' soundtracks on piano.
- Learn French, although I haven't made significant progress since three years ago.
